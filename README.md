I'm an eager developer student on the hunt for gainful employment (and maybe some snacks to fuel the learning process!). Right now, I'm absorbing knowledge like a slightly leaky sponge. Fair warning: you might encounter occasional syntax errors in my casual conversation. 🤓

Looking ahead, my future feature roadmap includes becoming a coding ninja! Contributions are definitely welcome, especially if you have a knack for explaining the mysteries of async/await. ✨

p.s. I'm a gamer all the hours I'm not coding 🎮 @ayfresh206 🎮
