💻 About Me
Developer student with a growing arsenal of skills in Node.js, Next.js, MongoDB, and more.
Currently focused on building projects that solve real-world problems while expanding my expertise.
Every bug I squash gets me closer to writing the kind of code that makes people say, “Damn, that’s clean.”

🚀 Future Roadmap:
	•	Master async/await and backend wizardry
	•	Build impactful apps that make a difference
	•	Turn my internship experience into a full-time dev career
